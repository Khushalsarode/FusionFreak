## 🚀 Inspiration  
Reddit is a hub of diverse communities, each with its own unique culture. We wanted to create a fun and engaging way to blend these communities together, sparking creativity, humor, and collaboration. FusionFreak brings the best of subreddit mashups into a game where users can fuse ideas and battle for the most upvoted creation!  

## 🎮 What it does  
FusionFreak is a word-based, community-driven game where users combine two subreddit names to create a clever fusion. Each round:  
🔹 A new subreddit pair is given.  
🔹 Players submit their best fusion ideas (max 15 words).  
🔹 The community upvotes their favorites.  
🔹 The highest-voted fusion wins and earns points!  

New rounds start daily, keeping the game fresh and competitive.  

## 🛠️ How we built it  
We developed FusionFreak using:  
🔹 **Reddit’s Devvit platform** for seamless subreddit integration.  
🔹 **TypeScript & JavaScript** for smooth game logic.  
🔹 **Reddit API** to fetch subreddit data and handle voting.  
🔹 **Firestore** for storing submissions and leaderboards.  
🔹 **React (for UI testing) & Markdown** for the user-friendly interface.  

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into  
🔹 **Balancing fairness:** Making sure upvoting is organic and not botted.  
🔹 **Reddit API limitations:** Handling subreddit name formatting quirks.  
🔹 **User engagement:** Encouraging creativity while keeping rules simple.
